            <dt>Object-oriented Language</dt>
            <dd>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", 
                which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of 
                procedures. A feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often 
                modify the data fields of itself. </dd>
            <dt>GUI</dt>
            <dd>A graphical user interface (GUI) allows a user to interact with a computer program using a 
                pointing device that manipulates small pictures on a computer screen. </dd>
            <dt>Open-source</dt>
                <dd>Open-source software is a type of computer software in which source code is released 
                under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, 
                change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software 
                may be developed in a collaborative public manner.</dd>
            <dt>dynamic Programming Language</dt>
            <dd>A dynamic programming language is a class of high-level programming languages, which at 
                runtime execute many common programming behaviours that static programming languages 
                perform during compilation.</dd>
